/* The main difference between the descendant combinator and the child combinator in CSS is the level of specificity in selecting elements within the DOM hierarchy. */
/* The descendant combinator selects all elements that are descendants of a specified element, regardless of their level of nesting. */
/* The child combinator selects only elements that are direct children of a specified element, meaning they are one level deeper in the DOM hierarchy. */

/* In CSS, child selectors, descendant selectors, and chaining selectors all allow you to target elements, but they do so in different ways. Here's how each one works:

1. Child Selector (>)
The child selector targets only the direct children of an element.

Syntax: parent > child 
This will style only the p elements that are direct children of a div (not grandchildren or further descendants).

2. Descendant Selector (Space)
The descendant selector targets all elements that are descendants (children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, etc.) of a specific element, regardless of depth.

Syntax: ancestor descendant
This will style all p elements that are inside a div, no matter how deep the p element is nested.


3 Chaining Selectors
Chaining selectors means combining multiple selectors (like class, ID, or type selectors) to target a more specific element. The element must match all the conditions in the chain.

Syntax: selector1.selector2, selector1#id, etc.*/
